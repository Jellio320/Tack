# Tack (T)ext P(ack)er)

Still a WIP, a hobby project to learn C.

When working, the program will be able to encrypt/pack text by taking letters & the most common combinations of letters in the English language and encrypt them with a single ASCII(possibly include UTF-8 in the future for much larger combinations?) symbol and decrypt text that has been encrypted. For commands/escape character, '#', '[', and ']' will be used.

# Example
The string "hello world" could be converted into "=&i0 8S-%"
